   1. Data integrity : this is defined as the overall completeness , accuracy and consistency of the data. The real integrity comes by emposing constraints on the data to enforce data integrity. This helps us enforce business rules and accuracy.
   2. Data Security : most relational database management systems have sophisticated access controls. Your database admins can impose who gets access to which data. (limitation of the data access.).
   3. Backups : most database languages have import and export functionality to create backups.
